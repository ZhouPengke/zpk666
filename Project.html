<h1>Website</h1>
<p>This website is mainly used for shopping. Merchants can set up their shops on our website, 
and we are responsible for promoting them and acting as a shopping intermediary. 
The website is connected to the cloud, and customers place orders through mobile devices or wired devices. 
The information of customers' orders will be transmitted to the server of the website through the cloud, 
and the server will deliver delivery information to merchants through various channels. We only need to 
maintain the operation of the website to charge corresponding service fees to merchants.</p>

         <td>Name: The significance of this attribute is that if multiple data sources exist, they can be distinguished by name during monitoring. If not, a name is generated in the form "DataSource-" + system.identityHashCode (this). In addition, setting this property does not work at least in version 1.0.5, forcing name will cause an error.
